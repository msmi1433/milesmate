## This project is a work in progress (8/11/2023)

An update will be provided when version 1.00 of MilesMate has been released.

# MilesMate

As airlines consistently move the goalposts of their loyalty schemes, it is becoming increasingly difficult for travellers to redeeem miles/points that they have earned.

MilesMate is aiming to level the playing field by providing a tool that will allow users to easily search for destinations that they can travel to using their miles/points balances. Initially, this will be done by providing a search tool where users can input the amount of miles/points that they have and be presented with all of the destinations that they can travel to using their balance.

The web app will also provide users with a chatbot that provides tips on how to book award flights once they have identified a journey that they want to book, and an accounts system so they can track their progress towards a goal flight.

MilesMate will initially be released with support for searching British Airways flights departing from London. Other airlines will be added once version 1.00 has been released.

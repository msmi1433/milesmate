# MilesMate

As airlines consistently move the goalposts of their loyalty schemes, it is becoming increasingly difficult for travelers to redeem miles/points that they have earned.

MilesMate is aiming to level the playing field by providing a tool that will allow users to easily search for destinations that they can travel to using their miles/points balances.

## Future updates

- Accounts system that will allow users to track their air miles balances across all of their accounts in one place.
- More airlines in the data base; Virgin Atlantic will be added next.
- A knowledge hub/chatbot that will give users tips on how to redeem their air miles once they have picked a trip that they want to book.
